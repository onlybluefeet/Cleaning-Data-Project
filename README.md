# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This is the project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course by Coursera. 

This project demonstrates the collection, and cleaning of a data set into a tidy data set for later analysis. A description of the data can be found at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The data set can be downloaded [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). 

## Summary

The `run_analysis.R` script, does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

You can find more information about the variables, data, and the transformations in the CodeBook.md.
